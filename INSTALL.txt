Install with python using distutils

The original tar.gz is made by 'python3 setup.py sdist' and can be untarred and installed by:

    tar -xzf qcp-x.x.x.tar.gz

    cd qcp-x.x.x

    python3 -m setup.py build

    python3 -m setup.py install

This will create a folder called build with the library of source files and the excecutables in scripts-x.x. The excecutable uses /usr/bin/env python3 and so python3 must be loaded.
